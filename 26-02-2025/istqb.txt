Fundamentals of Testing
-----------------------

What is Testing?
	•	Software testing is a set of activities to discover defects and evaluate the quality of software artifacts. These artifacts, when being tested, are known as test objects.
	•	A common misconception about testing is that it only consists of executing tests (i.e., running the software and checking the test results).
	•	Another common misconception about testing is that testing focuses entirely on verifying the test object.
	•	Testing may be dynamic or static.
	•	Testing is not only a technical activity. It also needs to be properly planned, managed, estimated, monitored, and controlled.

Test Objectives---- Objectives of testing

The typical test objectives are:
	•	Evaluating work products such as requirements, user stories, designs, and code
	•	Triggering failures and finding defects
	•	Ensuring required coverage of a test object
	•	Reducing the level of risk of inadequate software quality
	•	Verifying whether specified requirements have been fulfilled
	•	Verifying that a test object complies with contractual, legal, and regulatory requirements
	•	Providing information to stakeholders to allow them to make informed decisions
	•	Building confidence in the quality of the test object
	•	Validating whether the test object is complete and works as expected by the stakeholders

Testing and Debugging
----------------------------------------
	•	Testing and debugging are separate activities.
	•	Testing can trigger failures that are caused by defects in the software (dynamic testing) or can directly find defects in the test object (static testing).
	•	When dynamic testing triggers a failure, debugging is concerned with finding causes of this failure (defects), analyzing these causes, and eliminating them.
	•	The typical debugging process in this case involves:
	•	Reproduction of a failure
	•	Diagnosis (finding the root cause)
	•	Fixing the cause
	•	When static testing identifies a defect, debugging is concerned with removing it. There is no need for reproduction or diagnosis, since static testing directly finds defects and cannot cause failures.
