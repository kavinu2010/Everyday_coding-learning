ML introduction
---------------
Layers of machine learning >> AI >> ML >> Deep learning
AI --> machine that performs jobs that mimic the human behaviour
ML --> machine that better at a task without explicit programming
DL --> Machine that have an artificial neural networking isnpired 
by the human brain to solve the complex probelm

what is a data scientists? 
A person with multi-disciplinary skills in maths, statistics, 
predicitve modeling and machine learning to make feauture prediction

key elements of AI
-----------------
AI is the software that imitates human behaviour and capabilities
Key elements(according to the azure/microsoft):
>> Machien learning - foundation of AI system, learn and predict like a human
>> Anomaly detection - detect outliers or things out of place like a human
>> computer vision - be able to see like a human
>> NLP - be able to process a human language and infer context
>> Converstastional AI - be able to hold a converstation with a human

Datasets
--------
its a logical grouping of units of data that are closely related and or share the same data structure
there are publicly available data sets that are used in the 
learning of statistics, data analytics, ML

MNIST database::- iamges of handwritten digits used to test classification,
clustering and image processign algorithm
handwritten into ------> digital text[commonly used when learning how to build computer vision ML models to translating
handwriting tot the digital txt]
COCO(common object in context)dataset :- A dataset contain many common images using a JSON files(coco format)
that idemtify object or  segment with in an iameg 
features----->object segmenttation, ecoggnition in context, superpixel stuff segmentation
329k images(>200k labeled), 0.5 million object instances, 79 object categories, 90 stuff categories, 4 cation per images
249,000people with keypoints


Labeling(data labeling)
-----------------------
the process of identifying raw data(images, txt files,videos etc) and adding one or more meaningful or 
infromative labls to provide context so that machine learning model can learn
   >> With supervised machine learning, labeling is a prerequisite to produce training data and each piece of data 
   will generally labeled by a human
   >> With unsupervised machine learning, labels will be produce by the machine, and may not be human readable.

what is ground truth?
A properly labeled dataset that you used as the objective standard to train and access a given model is often called
ground truth [ THe accuracy of ur trained models depends upon the accuracy of ur ground truth]

Supervised and Unsupervised reinforcement
