ML introduction
---------------
Layers of machine learning >> AI >> ML >> Deep learning
AI --> machine that performs jobs that mimic the human behaviour
ML --> machine that better at a task without explicit programming
DL --> Machine that have an artificial neural networking isnpired 
by the human brain to solve the complex probelm

what is a data scientists? 
A person with multi-disciplinary skills in maths, statistics, 
predicitve modeling and machine learning to make feauture prediction

key elements of AI
-----------------
AI is the software that imitates human behaviour and capabilities
Key elements(according to the azure/microsoft):
>> Machien learning - foundation of AI system, learn and predict like a human
>> Anomaly detection - detect outliers or things out of place like a human
>> computer vision - be able to see like a human
>> NLP - be able to process a human language and infer context
>> Converstastional AI - be able to hold a converstation with a human

Datasets
--------
its a logical grouping of units of data that are closely related and or share the same data structure
there are publicly available data sets that are used in the 
learning of statistics, data analytics, ML

MNIST database::- iamges of handwritten digits used to test classification,
clustering and image processign algorithm
handwritten into ------> digital text[commonly used when learning how to build computer vision ML models to translating
handwriting tot the digital txt]
COCO(common object in context)dataset :- A dataset contain many common images using a JSON files(coco format)
that idemtify object or  segment with in an iameg 
features----->object segmenttation, recoggnition in context, superpixel stuff segmentation
329k images(>200k labeled), 0.5 million object instances, 79 object categories, 90 stuff categories, 4 cation per images
249,000people with keypoints


Labeling(data labeling)
-----------------------
the process of identifying raw data(images, txt files,videos etc) and adding one or more meaningful or 
infromative labls to provide context so that machine learning model can learn
   >> With supervised machine learning, labeling is a prerequisite to produce training data and each piece of data 
   will generally labeled by a human
   >> With unsupervised machine learning, labels will be produce by the machine, and may not be human readable.

what is ground truth?
A properly labeled dataset that you used as the objective standard to train and access a given model is often called
ground truth [ THe accuracy of ur trained models depends upon the accuracy of ur ground truth]

Supervised and Unsupervised  and Reinforcement
--------------------------------------------

SL - data that has been labeld for training
task-driven - make a prediciton
when the labels are known and you want a precise outcome. when you need a specific valued return
ex: classification , regression
UL - data has not been labeld , the ML model needs to do irs own labeling
data-driven - recognise a structure pr pattern
whne the labels are not known and the outcoem doesnt need to be precise
when ur'e make a sense of data
ex: clustering, dimentionality reduction, association
RL - There is no data, there is an environment and an  ML model generated data many attempts to reach the goal
decison driven - game AI,learning tasks,video game, robot navigation


Neural network and deep learning
--------------------------------
NN - often descibes as mimicking the brain, a neuron/ node represents an alogorithm
data is inputed into a neurons  based on the outputs the data will be passed to one or many other connected neurals
the connection between neurons is weighted
the network is organised in layers
there will be a input layer, 1 to many hidden layers and an output layers
DL - A nueral netwoek that as 3 or more layers is considered as DL

what is a feed forward?(FNN)forward feed neural network
NN connection between nodes do not form a cycle(always moves a forward)

what is backpropagation ? (BP)
Moves backward through the neural network adjusting weight to improve outcome on next iteration. this is how neural net learns

Loos functions?
a function that compared to the ground truth  to the predicition to determine the error data(how bad the network performed)

activation function ?
an algorithm that applied to a hidden layer node that affects connected output eg ReLu
dense, sparse

GPU:: Graphical processing unit
--------------------------------
specially designed to quickly render high-resolution images and video concurrently
it can perform parallel operations or multiple sets of data, tey used of non graphical 
tasks such as ML and scientific computation
CPU - has average 4 to 5 processor cores
GPU - can provide as many as 40000 cores
best suited for repetitive and highly - parallel computing tasks
>> Rendering grpahics
>> crypto currency mining
>> Deep learning and ML


Compute unified device architecture (CUDA)
-----------------------------------
What is NVIDIA?
Is a company that manufactures GPUs for gaming and professional markets
CUDA --> is a parallel computing platform and API by NVIDIA that developers to use
CUDA-enabled GPUs for general purpose computing on (GPGPU)

All major DL frameworks are integrated with NVIDIA deep learning SDK

The NVIDIA deep learning SDK is collection of NVIDIA libraries for DL
one of those libraries is the CUDA deep neural networking library (cuDNN)
cuDNN provides highly tuned implementations for standard routine such as:
>> Forward and backwqard convolution(CV)
>> pooling
>> Noemalization
>> Activation layers

Simple ML pipeline
------------------
Data labeling--->Feature engineering--->Training--->Hyperparameter tunning
--->serving--->::interfaces::____>Real-time endpoint____>Batch processing
DL - for supervised learning you need to label your data so the ML model
    can learn by example during training
FE - ML models only work with numerical data. so u need to translate
     it into a format that it can understand, extract out the important data that
     the ML needs to focus on 
Tr - ur model need to learn how to become smarter. it will perform multiple
     iterations getting smarter with each iteration
HT - An ML model can have ifferent parameters, we can use ML to try out many
     different parameters to optimize the outcome
Se - we need to make are ML model accessible, so we serve by hosting in a 
     virtual machine or container
interface is the act of requesting to make prediction


Forecasting VS prediciotns
--------------------------
Forecasting---> makes a future prediction with relevant data
>> Analysis of trends
>> Its not 'guessing'
Prediction---> Makes a future predicition without relevant data
>> uses statics to predicit future outcomes 
>> Its more of 'guessing'
>> Uses decision theory

     
Evalation metrics(Performance / Evaluating metrices)
----------------------------------------------------
Are use to evalaute different machine learning algorithms
for different types of problem differnt metrics matter(this is not exhaustive list)
>> classification metrics(accuracy, precision,recall, F1-score, ROC, AUC)
>> Regression metrices (MSE, RMSE MAE)
>> Ranking metrics (MRR, DCG, NDCG)
>> Statistical Metrics(correlation)
>> computer vision metrics (PSNR,SSIM, ioU)
>> NLP metrics (Preplexity, BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE)
>> DL related metrics (inception score, Frechet inception distance)

2 categories of evaluation metrics
internal evaluation - metrics used to evaluate the internals of ML model
 >> accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall (the famous four) used in all kinds of models
exterrnal evaluation - metrics used to evaluate the final prediction of the ML model


Jupyter Notebook
----------------
A Web-based application for authoring documents that combine:

Live-code
Narrative text
Equations
Visualizations
iPythonâ€™s notebook feature became Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebooks were overhauled and better integrated into an IDE called JupyterLab

You generally want to open Notebooks in Labs
The legacy web-based interface is known as
Jupyter classic notebook 
jupyter lab ---> is a next generation web-based user interface
all thefamiliar features of the classic jupyter notbook in a flexible and poweful user interface
notebook >> terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs
jupyterlab will eventually replace the classical jupyter notebook
