ML introduction
---------------
Layers of machine learning >> AI >> ML >> Deep learning
AI --> machine that performs jobs that mimic the human behaviour
ML --> machine that better at a task without explicit programming
DL --> Machine that have an artificial neural networking isnpired 
by the human brain to solve the complex probelm

what is a data scientists? 
A person with multi-disciplinary skills in maths, statistics, 
predicitve modeling and machine learning to make feauture prediction

key elements of AI
-----------------
AI is the software that imitates human behaviour and capabilities
Key elements(according to the azure/microsoft):
>> Machien learning - foundation of AI system, learn and predict like a human
>> Anomaly detection - detect outliers or things out of place like a human
>> computer vision - be able to see like a human
>> NLP - be able to process a human language and infer context
>> Converstastional AI - be able to hold a converstation with a human

Datasets
--------
its a logical grouping of units of data that are closely related and or share the same data structure
