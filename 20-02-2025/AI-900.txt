what is AI? Its a software/computer system attempts to 
copy the behaviour and actions of the humans

These are 5 key elements of AI

1. Machine leaning[Foundation of most AI system]:
>> Machine can learn to make predictions
>> use a data to train a machine learning models to make prediction
>> Predictiong walking time
>> Forecasting Demand
>> Classifying high or low risk category
>> focusing on predicting values,classes and grouping of objects


Machine learning using a data to train a machine
predict, clasify or grouped data. bank loan applier is low or high risk debt loan


2. Anomaly detection: any thing that deviate from the normal pattern / detect abnormal pattern in the data
health, data, 
>> use machine learning to analyse the data
>> watches are trends and find outliers in the data
>> Fradulent charges: illegal transaction. 

oil is run out in vehicle, temerature of vehicle is increases are the example(early mechanical failure)


3. computer vision : see the world and examine images and videos
facial recognization(unlock phoneor ccomputer for security purposes, recognize text in the picture)
>> extract text from the picture
>> unlock phone or computer of security purposes
>> Person is wearing glasses or not


4. Natural language processing: to create software that underdtands written and spoken languages
>> (siri google, gps application, sppech recognization - speech syntehesis to talk back to us)
>> Home automation, translate languagese
>> Determine positive and negative statement


5. conversational AI: AI system can have  conversation with us
>> chatbot, 

Knowledge mining


Responsible AI principal
Creating responsible AI:  PRINCIPLES
Fairness /  reliability and safety / privacy and security / inclusivness >/ transperancy / accountability

Fairness: Ai(application doesnt descrminate) should treat all ppl fairly ( Accept or reject loan application) ( not descrimiate based on gender
, disability or any other factor)

Reliability and safety: Medicine , self car driving: AI system prescribing medication need to beeliable and safe

Privacy and security:user data should not br leaked or disclosed (confidential patient record)

Inclusivness:(available for everyone) All people can use AI, irrespecive of gnder, race, ethnicity, physical ability if they are blind 
they can access the result

Tranparency: (how it works and limitaions are )after <AI mskes decision we shold have right to know. how it works and whats the limitations are

Accountability: (ppl who are creatidn ai system should follow/meet legal and ethical standard) people should be help accountable for AI system
AI system should follow governance abd frameworksnto meet legal and ethical standars(human rights)
