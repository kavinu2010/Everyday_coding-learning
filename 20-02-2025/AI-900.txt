what is AI? Its a software/computer system attempts to 
copy the behaviour and actions of the humans

These are 5 key elements of AI

1. Machine learning[Foundation of most AI system]:
>> Machine can learn to make predictions
>> use a data to train a machine learning models to make prediction
>> Predictiong walking time
>> Forecasting Demand
>> Classifying high or low risk category
>> focusing on predicting values,classes and grouping of objects


Machine learning using a data to train a machine
predict, clasify or grouped data. bank loan applier is low or high risk debt loan


2. Anomaly detection: any thing that deviate from the normal pattern / detect abnormal pattern in the data
health, data, 
>> use machine learning to analyse the data
>> watches are trends and find outliers in the data
>> Fradulent charges: illegal transaction. 

oil is run out in vehicle, temerature of vehicle is increases are the example(early mechanical failure)


3. computer vision : see the world and examine images and videos
facial recognization(unlock phoneor ccomputer for security purposes, recognize text in the picture)
>> extract text from the picture
>> unlock phone or computer of security purposes
>> Person is wearing glasses or not


4. Natural language processing: to create software that underdtands written and spoken languages
>> (siri google, gps application, sppech recognization - speech syntehesis to talk back to us)
>> Home automation, translate languagese
>> Determine positive and negative statement
>> it reduce workload by answering questions


5. conversational AI: AI system can have  conversation with us
>> chatbot, ordering food

Knowledge mining:
 Use AI to quickly learn from vast amounts of informations
>> Data extractions
>> pull data from variety of resources
>> enrich the data
>> Explore the data

>> Ingest scientific documents
>> Pull out key phrases and key words
>> publish to searchable library


Responsible AI principal
Creating responsible AI: We need to follow certain PRINCIPLES
Fairness /  reliability and safety / privacy and security / inclusivness / transperancy / accountability

Fairness: Ai(application doesnt descrminate) should treat all ppl fairly ( Accept or reject loan application) ( not descrimiate based on gender
, disability or any other factor)
>> limit the biases in AI system Ex: reject/aprrove loan applications


Reliability and safety: Medicine , self car driving: AI system prescribing medication need to beeliable and safe
>> rigorous testing
>> How to handle error in safe way

Privacy and security:user data should not br leaked or disclosed (confidential patient record)

Inclusivness:(available for everyone) All people can use AI, irrespecive of gnder, race, ethnicity, physical ability if they are blind 
they can access the result

Tranparency: (how it works and limitaions are )after <AI mskes decision we shold have right to know. how it works and whats the limitations are
>> Giving clear instructions and their limitations are

Accountability: (ppl who are creatidn ai system should follow/meet legal and ethical standard) people should be help accountable for AI system
AI system should follow governance abd frameworksnto meet legal and ethical standars(human rights)

Machine Learning:learning everything
what is ML, Important terminology, Azure service for ML

Techniques that uses maths and stataisticst to create a model that can predict unknown values

Featues and Labels: we need to train the model 
Azure automated ML
Azure ML designer

Types of ML:
Regression, classification, clustering, supervised and unsupervised learning

Regression >> Historical data with features to predict a numerical value/ label
used to predict the numerical value

Classification >> Using historical data prediction which class and categories belongs too
identifying diebetic patients, based on age and BMI
checking low risk and high risk in bank  using credit score and income

supervised learning: uses historical data for prediction


This is Unsupervised
Clustering >> Group the similar items into a cluster based on their features, here we are not predicing anuthing

Azure automated ML:
Exploring azure ML studio, set up a data set , train a regressoin model, evluate result, deploy the model



Computer Vision:
Introduction to cv 
exploring custom vision
exploring the  azure face service
reading text from image 
analysing receipts with form recognizer

Computer vision: How an AI system cans see the world
analyse images and return information about them
uses a pre-built computer vison model

Azure services : we can use computer vison with 2 services 

azure computer vision (Standalone)>> interact with service via API endpoint and key 
azure cognitive services >> the one service 2 rule them all
cognitive service includes computer vision along with other AI services(NLP and conversational AI)
>> under the cognitive services sits the computer vision service along with text analytics and azure speech and a few more  services

Standalone service vs cognitive services
SA >> you don't plann using other services
   >> You want to track utilizatoin aned costs for computer vision sepearately
CS >> use multiple AI services with only 1 resources
   >> Simplify adinistratoin with a single endpoint and key

Ability: >>  Descriptions >> CV can describe images
Tagging >>  Computer vison can suggest tags
object detection >> CV can detect objects >> Bounding box coordinates
Brand detection >> can deteect popular brand
Facial detection >> its diffeent as face recognization >> it deteermines if there is a face, the age and returning bounding box coordinates
categories >> categoriesimages
landmarks ad celebrities 
optical character recognition (OCR) or reading text from a picture
generate Thumbnails
moderate content >> detect image with adult content , violent, or gory scenes

Exploring custom vision::Both standalone and cognitive >>[image classify and detect objects] uses Image classification(own images and applying labels to it)

Azure face service::
>> Intro>> AF vs CV
>> AF capability
AF >>used to Detect,  analyse and recognize faces
Facial detection[cordent and bounding boxes] (Computer vision) VS Facial analysis
Facial analysis >> cabolitlies>> sunglasses, blurness, exposure and noise , Headpose, inclusion
Facial recognization >> training a  model to recognize someone based on their features
>> it detect in a group photos 
>> facial companriosion and facial identification

Reading text from images:: Reading text capabilites >> azure services

optical character recognization (OCR) Read API
model to train recognize text in an images(handwritten text or printed documnets)
computer vision read api provides quick extraction of  a small amount of text in an image

For large amount of text use FORM RECOGNIZER

Analysing receipts with form recognizer
>> Exploring FORm recognizer >> OCR vs Face recognizer >> Azure services
train ur own custom model to extract data
save 4hee time to type, reciepts, invoices, forms

OCR api is used to read the recipt but still we need to sort out address and whar fields belongs where
form recognizer will do all those things and match fields to the values

Services >> azzure form recognizer
azure cognitive servicces


Natural language processing:: Robot should speak now
> An introduction to NLP
> Leanrning to read with text analysis
> learning to talk with azure speech
> Hola tranlating text and speech
> Hey corta, start the coffee achine, lnaguage understadding on azure

NLP>> area of AI that can understand written and spoken language
:: digital assistant like siri, cortana, alexa
(understand spoken language and speak back to us)

uses >> Speech recognization, speech synthesis, 
speech or text translaion 


::capabilities::
1. Text analysis >> Analyze and interpre text in documents, emails and more we can extract >> sentiment determination(+ve or -ve messages)
>> extract key phrases 
>> detect entinities(dates, places / ppl)
2. Translation >> NLP can translate spoken or written text between langauges
like automated tranlation app >> eng to spanish
google translate
3. Language understanding:: itsnot always make them to talk, they also have to be able to understand and interpret us.


azure services (4 main services)
Text analystics, speech, translator, language understanding
>> Evaluate documents and ssentences to gain and idea of  the content of the text 
for any kind of examine we need to use text analysis
capabilities:: comments in a diffeent language(is it english, german, mixed english dominent or else it gives NAN)
Sentiment analysis(positie negative sentences 0 or 1)
